# Introduction
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a critical area of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret,and generate human language. This repository provides a structured path to learn NLP using multiple frameworks.
- Each folder within this repository contains code examples, datasets, and explanations to help you master various NLP techniques.

# Setup and Installation
- To get started, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies for each framework.
- git clone https://github.com/Izhar-Nabi/..

# Frameworks Covered
- NLTK
-- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is one of the leading platforms for building Python programs to work with human language data.

# nltk
- Features: Tokenization, POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and more.
- spaCy
- spaCy is an open-source software library for advanced NLP in Python.

# Spacy
- Features: Tokenization, POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Dependency Parsing, and more.
- TextBlob
- TextBlob is a simple library for processing textual data and provides a consistent API for diving into common NLP tasks.

# textblob

- Stanford NLP
- Stanford NLP provides a suite of NLP tools, including the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit.

# Basic Concepts
- Tokenization
-- Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens.

# Bag of Words (BoW)
- Bag of Words is a simple and commonly used method to represent text data for modeling.

# Intermediate Concepts
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
-- NER is the process of identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories.

# Part of Speech (POS) Tagging
- POS tagging involves labeling each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech.

# Advanced Concepts
- Sentiment Analysis
-- Sentiment Analysis is the process of detecting the sentiment or emotion conveyed in a piece of text.

# Text Classification
- Text Classification is the task of assigning predefined categories to text data.

# Audio-based Sentiment Analysis
- Audio-based Sentiment Analysis involves analyzing the sentiment conveyed in audio data.
